## Excel2Access File Converter


</div>

### Description

This code is used to convert entire Excel Workbooks to Access Databases. Each Excell Worksheet in the Workbook becomes a new Table in the new Access Database. This codes has a problem processing more than one file at a time without stopping and restarting the program. It looks as if it is processing the file but it never actually imports the next file's Worksheets. Try it and you will see what I mean. Any HELP would be appreciated.
 
### More Info
 
This program has problems processing multiple files with stopping and restarting the program. Any HELP would be appreciated.
